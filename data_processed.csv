Department of Radiology and Biomedical Imaging",False,Outpatient,Male,65.0,1,True,"Compared to 4/20/2022, significant interval increase in size of now large right pleural effusion with increase in atelectasis of the right lung. Given that the effusion is increased in size after thoracentesis, this raises suspicion for possible postprocedural hemorrhage into the pleural space.
